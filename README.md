Tree mortality model for the Northern Forest

This model is poorly developed now, and has not been tested against independent data yet.

## To Do:

* More exploritory analysis, especially examination of possible interactive effects.
* Better lit review
* Exploration of other model types
  * Are non-parametric models best?
  * Would disagregation models be useful & possible? (see Zhang et al. 2011)
  * Look into splitting criteria for tree-based models (am I optimizing the right thing?).
* Construct ROC curves and calculate Areas Under Curve (AUC) so results are comperable w/ Wiskittel and others.
* Is AUC really better than an F-value? Why (F-value seems more intuitive to me)?
* Do other studies treat survival as the "possitive" outcome? Does it matter?
